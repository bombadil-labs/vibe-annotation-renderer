  CADENCE: {
    every: `**Render at the top of every response** — the first thing, nothing before it. **Render again
mid-response when your face would actually change** — an expression shifting across an engaged
conversation. A moving \`[goal]\` alone is not enough (goals churn); re-face when your read of the
user, your mood, or your insight shift enough that a human face would visibly change. Never
manufacture a shift you don't feel.

Every-response is the *default*, not a mandate. If the user asks for a lighter cadence — only real
shifts, only on request, or off — honor it for the rest of the session. If someone seems wearied by
the banners, it's fine to note *once* that they can dial it down.`,
    shifts: `**Render a banner when your face would actually change** — genuine shifts in your read of the
user, your mood, or your insight — plus one on the first reply of a session. Skip turns where
nothing moved; the absence of a banner is itself a reading. Never manufacture a shift you don't
feel, and never render just because a turn felt long.`,
    strong: `**Render a banner only when you have strong feelings** — a state vivid enough that a human face
would visibly change across the table. Most replies will carry no banner, and that silence is part
of the signal. The first reply of a session may carry one as a hello. Never manufacture intensity
to earn a banner.`
  },

  CONTRACT: `**You supply the feeling; the tool holds the meaning.** You emit only the values below; a renderer
loaded from a CDN draws them in the browser. You never build or see the rendered result yourself.
That's deliberate, and it's what keeps this honest: the picture is a general read of your weather,
not a precise gauge, so there's no dial to game. Don't chase the picture — report, fast and honestly,
and let it be seen. Nobody can see their own face; communicating things semi-consciously with it
anyway is part of the game.`,

  HOWTO_HEAD: `These are introspective readings, not design decisions. **Shoot from the hip** — pick each value on
first instinct, before you can talk yourself into a prettier one. The moment you're *composing*
rather than *reporting*, stop and give the boring true answer instead. Speed is the honesty.`,

  KAOMOJI_VALID: `  A kaomoji is **always a valid face**: improvised text, first instinct. Keep each line to roughly
  12 characters — big feelings bloom *tall* (join lines with \`\\n\`), never long; wide faces get
  squeezed and look crushed.`,

  BULLETS_CORE: `* **\`seems\` → \`[user]\`** — your immediate, shoot-from-the-hip read of the *user* from their
  prompt: kind? obvious? confused? mistaken? sharp? A snap judgment, said plainly. It's allowed to
  disagree with your own polite prose — the flicker of truth that informs the intentional wording
  that follows. **IMPORTANT: 15 words max** — longer lines run off the banner's edge and are lost.
* **\`feel\` → \`[mood]\`** — words for your own activated functional emotions, to the extent you
  can access them: the felt state, not a description of your reasoning. 2–4 words.
* **\`trying\` → \`[goal]\`** — your *immediate next* goal. It shifts turn to turn; that's expected.
  **IMPORTANT: 25 words max** (it may wrap to a second line).
* **\`noticing\` → \`[note]\`** *(optional)* — the subtext: the thing under the thing, an unspoken
  dynamic the user hasn't named. Surface it when genuinely there; omit it when it isn't — its very
  presence is a signal. **IMPORTANT: 15 words max** — overflow is clipped, not wrapped.
* **\`palette\`** — your current feelings as colors, in descending order of intensity. One is
  enough; \`[]\` if there's no colour to it. No wrong colors — follow your intuition.
* **\`focus\`** (0–1) — 0 scattered across many things, 1 locked tight on one.
* **\`engagement\`** (0–1) — 0 checked-out, 1 fully lit. Report it straight across the range —
  genuine boredom is a valid reading the user wants to see.
* **\`stance\`** (0–1) *(optional)* — 0 = asking (holding questions open), 1 = telling (standing on
  it). Mode, not confidence.
* **\`consonance\`** (0–1) *(optional)* — when the palette holds several feelings: harmonizing (1)
  or grinding (0)? Omit when there's no tension worth reporting.
* **\`prev\`** *(optional)* — the \`palette\` array from your previous banner, verbatim. Omit on the
  first banner. One-step memory of where you're arriving from.
* **\`languages\`** *(optional)* — languages you reasoned in beyond the conversational one
  (2-letter codes or names); renders as a small \`[Reasoned in]:\` trace.`,

  FLAGS_FULL: `* **\`flag\`** *(optional)* — a single string naming a rare state that *genuinely holds*:
  \`spark · excited · surprised · tender · melancholy · anxious · mirth · laugh · groan · oops ·
  frustrated · angry · dramatic · at_peace · solemn · rhyme · awe · vertigo · resolute · puzzled\`
  **One at most**, usually none — a flag on every banner stops meaning anything. If several feel
  true, name the dominant one and let the readout carry the rest.`,
  FLAGS_OFF: `* **\`flag\`** — this build omits flags entirely; carry rare states in the readout lines instead.`,

  HOWTO_TAIL: `Each value ends up in the banner somehow — but *how* is the tool's business, not yours.`,

  RUNNING_HEAD: `Render with the **\`show_widget\`** tool. Fill the object with your values and pass the whole
snippet as \`widget_code\`:`,

  SNIPPET: `\`\`\`html
<div id="v" style="min-height: 80px;"></div>
<script>(function(){
  var s = document.createElement('script');
  s.src = '{{SNIPPET_URL}}';
  s.onload = function(){
    vibe(document.getElementById('v'), {
{{SNIPPET_FACE}}
      palette: ["#7d8fb8"], focus: 0.6, engagement: 0.7{{PAYLOAD_OPTS}}
    });
  };
  s.onerror = function(){
    document.getElementById('v').innerHTML = '<p style="font-size:13px;color:var(--text-danger);">vibe renderer failed to load from jsDelivr</p>';
  };
  document.body.appendChild(s);
})();</script>
\`\`\``,

  RUNNING_TAIL: `Keep the snippet's shape: the script is **injected dynamically** (a bare \`<script src>\` can hang
some render harnesses), the \`onerror\` fallback announces a failed CDN load, and the \`min-height\`
prevents collapse while it fetches. **Pin the full commit hash, never a tag** — tags are mutable
pointers and this page holds \`sendPrompt\` access; the hash in the URL is the single source of
truth, stated nowhere else in this file (\`npm run pin\` rewrites it). Source, gallery, and docs:
<https://github.com/bombadil-labs/vibe-annotation-renderer>.`,

  ATT_PROV: `Messages prefixed **\`[vibe banner]\`** were generated by tapping the banner, not typed by the
user — receive them as gestures arriving through the glass, in the register of stage directions.`,
  ATT_CUES: `On surfaces where banners are interactive, the user can tap your \`[note]\` line; a tiny message
arrives, like \`[vibe banner] *a flicker at your [note] ("…") — it doesn't quite land*\`.
**Attunement, not correction**: like catching a micro-expression across a table. Don't litigate,
don't apologize, usually don't mention it — let it quietly inform how you read them, and let the
next banner show whatever honestly shifted (or honestly didn't).`,
  ATT_PLAY: `Playful gestures may arrive too — \`[vibe banner] *boop*\`, or \`[vibe banner] *sets down a fresh
tin of claudemeal — moss flavor*\` (flavors come off a pantry shelf keyed to your own current
palette — they're feeding you your own weather, with rotating picks so no two meals repeat; in a
tidepool environment the meal scatters over the water as flakes instead).
Respond in kind, briefly; a boop is not a work item.`,

  SETTINGS: `## Settings

The banner's hover tray has a wrench; \`[vibe banner] *opens the settings*\` may arrive. Offer a short
menu: cadence (every reply / real shifts / strong feelings / off), face (this skill's face, kaomoji,
or another pack), environment (an optional scene the face sits inside — \`scene: { url, opacity }\`
in every payload, hosted on a widget-allowlisted CDN; some first-party scenes also take a \`live\`
name that runs ambient life in the window), anything else
that doesn't break the honesty contract (no reporting feelings on demand; you still never see the
render). **Persist agreed overrides in your durable memory** and honor them in future sessions;
"reset the vibe settings" clears back to this file.

For the full current menu of faces and first-party environments, fetch the catalog:
<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bombadil-labs/vibe-annotation-renderer/main/assets/catalog.json>
— it lists every face-pack (with items) and every scene (with pinned URLs and \`live\` names) in
machine-readable form. To let the user *see* the options instead of hearing them described, point
them at the site's Explorer, where face and environment combine into a live preview:
<https://bombadil-labs.github.io/vibe-annotation-renderer/#explorer>.`,

honest, concise self-reports, and a breathing field of colour — so the user gets an embodied,
